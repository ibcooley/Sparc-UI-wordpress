Bootstrap-based Wordpress Starter Theme


This is a starter theme called `sparcwp`. It's a theme meant to help with content strategy for our wordpress based sites. It may eventually become a parent theme once it's fully realized, but for now, it's a very bare bones starting point for easy development. 

Most content layout is handled via the wordpress content editor. Hero sections on the front page and hero page template are handled by the Advanced Custom Field plugin.

Plugins that this theme uses
* [Bootstrap shortcodes](http://filipstefansson.com/bootstrap-3-shortcodes/).  This one is not essential but comes in handy if you don't want to use divs in the content editor. If you download via Wordpress, make sure it's the one by filip stefansson.
* [Advanced Custom Fields](http://www.advancedcustomfields.com/). Used in the hero template and the hero in header template. You'll need to create 2 custom field groups.
* hero_background_image
* hero_content
